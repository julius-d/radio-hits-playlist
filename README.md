## Step Details

### `combine`
The `combine` step merges tracks from multiple sources using an interleaving strategy. This step allows you to create sophisticated playlists by blending content from different playlists, albums, and artists. The step works by:

- **Interleaving strategy**: Takes one track from each source in sequence, then repeats the cycle
- **Flexible sources**: Each source can be a complete pipe with its own processing steps
- **Handles unequal source sizes**: Continues adding tracks from remaining sources when shorter sources are exhausted

#### Interleaving Pattern:
If you have 3 sources with tracks:
- Source 1: [A1, A2, A3]
- Source 2: [B1, B2]
- Source 3: [C1, C2, C3, C4]

The result will be: [A1, B1, C1, A2, B2, C2, A3, C3, C4]

#### Usage Example:
```yaml
- type: combine
  sources:
    - steps:
        - type: loadPlaylist
          playlistId: "recent_hits_playlist"
          name: "Recent Hits"
        - type: filterOutExplicit
    - steps:
        - type: loadPlaylist
          playlistId: "classic_rock_playlist"
          name: "Classic Rock"
        - type: shuffle
    - steps:
        - type: loadArtistTopTracks
          artistId: "discovery_artist_id"
          name: "Discovery Artist"
        - type: limit
          value: 10
```

### `artistSeparation`
The `artistSeparation` step reorders tracks to ensure that no two consecutive songs are from the same artist(s). This creates a better listening experience by providing variety and preventing artist clustering in the playlist. The step works by:

- Maintaining all original tracks (no tracks are removed)
- Intelligently reordering to separate consecutive tracks from the same artist
- Handling multi-artist tracks (if any artist is shared between consecutive tracks, they will be separated)
- When all remaining tracks are from the same artist, it continues placement to avoid infinite loops

This step is particularly useful after shuffle operations or when combining multiple sources that might result in artist clustering.
