## Step Details

### `combine`
The `combine` step merges tracks from multiple sources using an interleaving strategy. This step allows you to create sophisticated playlists by blending content from different playlists, albums, and artists. The step works by:

- **Interleaving strategy**: Takes one track from each source in sequence, then repeats the cycle
- **Flexible sources**: Each source can be a complete pipe with its own processing steps
- **Handles unequal source sizes**: Continues adding tracks from remaining sources when shorter sources are exhausted

#### Interleaving Pattern:
If you have 3 sources with tracks:
- Source 1: [A1, A2, A3]
- Source 2: [B1, B2]
- Source 3: [C1, C2, C3, C4]

The result will be: [A1, B1, C1, A2, B2, C2, A3, C3, C4]


### `artistSeparation`
The `artistSeparation` step reorders tracks to ensure that no two consecutive songs are from the same artist(s). This creates a better listening experience by providing variety and preventing artist clustering in the playlist. The step works by:

- Maintaining all original tracks (no tracks are removed)
- Intelligently reordering to separate consecutive tracks from the same artist
- Handling multi-artist tracks (if any artist is shared between consecutive tracks, they will be separated)
- When all remaining tracks are from the same artist, it continues placement to avoid infinite loops

This step is particularly useful after shuffle operations or when combining multiple sources that might result in artist clustering.

### `loadArtistNewestAlbum`
The `loadArtistNewestAlbum` step loads all tracks from an artist's newest album or release. 
This step allows you to automatically include the latest content from your favorite artists without manually tracking their new releases.

#### Parameters:
- `artistId` (required): The Spotify artist ID
- `name` (required): A descriptive name for the step (used for logging)
- `albumTypes` (optional): Array of album types to consider. Defaults to `["album"]`
- `excludingAlbumsWithTitleContaining` (optional): Array of strings. If an album's title contains any of these strings, it will be excluded from consideration. Useful for excluding "Deluxe Edition", "Remastered", etc.

#### Supported Album Types:
- `"album"` - Full-length albums
- `"single"` - Singles and individual tracks  
- `"compilation"` - Compilation albums
- `"appears_on"` - Tracks that appear on compilations and various artist collections

#### Notes:
- Returns empty list if no matching albums are found
- Newest release is determined by Spotify's release date sorting
- When excluding albums by title, the step will select the newest non-excluded album
