# Cursor Rules for Java Maven Project

## Code Formatting and Testing
- After making any changes to Java code, always run `mvn spotless:apply` to format the code according to Google Java Format
- After applying formatting, run `mvn test` to ensure all tests still pass
- If tests fail, investigate and fix the issues before proceeding
- Apply these rules automatically for any Java file modifications in the src/ directory

## Workflow
1. Make code changes
2. Run `mvn spotless:apply` to format code
3. Run `mvn test` to verify tests pass
4. If tests fail, debug and fix issues
5. Only consider the changes complete when both formatting and tests are successful

## Additional Notes
- The project uses Google Java Format style with spotless plugin version 2.43.0
- Always ensure code is properly formatted before committing
- Maintain test coverage and ensure all existing tests continue to pass
